# **OT_SECURITY**
## Int3rc3pt3
METHODS: <br/>
•	Open the secret.zip file in Wireshark and examine the packet capture of satellite communication <br/>
•	By going through the intercepted data to identify commands exchanged between the satellite and ground station we’ll be able to identify an encoded message <br/>
•	Then decode that message to extract the original message, revealing the flag <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT: <br/>
•	We will understand how satellite and ground station interactions are represented in network traffic.<br/>
•	And also how to reverse these interactions to retrieve readable data.<br/>
